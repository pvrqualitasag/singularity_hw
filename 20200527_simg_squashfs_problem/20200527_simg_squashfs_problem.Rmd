# Disclaimer
Documentation and trials of reproduction of the problem on squashfs in singularity reported by Eildert.


# Setup
Use ubuntu 18.04 and 20.04 to check potential differences in the behavior. Each of the two systems are created in docker with different docker files.


# Experiments
## Neuro-Debian Package repository
Using `Dockerfile_ubuntu_18.04` with ubuntu bionic, the package `singularity-container` can be installed using the repository under http://neuro.debian.net/. This results in an installed version of '2.6.1-dist' of singularity. 

Unfortunately, the corresponding `singularity-container` is not available for ubuntu 20.04 (focal). The installation stops with the error

```
E: Package 'singularity-container' has no installation candidate
```

Using the 19.04 (disco) settings of neuro-debian leads to an installation of singularity version '2.6.1-dist'.

Hence this approach works, but the installed version of singularity is old.
